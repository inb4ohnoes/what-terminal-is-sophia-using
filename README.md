# What terminal is Sophia using

<img src="Screenshot.png" width="500">

This was taken from [Felix's repo](https://github.com/KrauseFx/what-terminal-is-felix-using).

- I use [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) instead of the Stock terminal Mac app
- I use [oh-my-zshell](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
- I use [Solarized Dark](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) for the terminal colors
- I use [powerline-shell](https://github.com/milkbikis/powerline-shell) to get those cool path bars. I usually hide the host name and the user, as I know who I am (more information below)
- I use the [Meslo Powerline Font](https://github.com/powerline/fonts/blob/master/Meslo/Meslo%20LG%20M%20DZ%20Regular%20for%20Powerline.otf) as you need a font that supports the directory characters for `powerline`
